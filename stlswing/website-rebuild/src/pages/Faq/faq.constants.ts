    question: 'Can I join a class that has already started?',
    answer:
      'Yes, with caveats.  If you have teacher permission, are confident in the material, or have taken the previous classes A La Carte.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What class should I take?',
    answer:
      'How much experience do you have?  If you have never danced before, you should start with our Starting Swing series. If you have some experience, our intermediate level classes are likely a better fit.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a partner?',
    answer:
      'No! We try our best to balance classes and will rotate partners throughout the class. It’s a great way to meet new people and learn more.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What do I wear to a class?',
    answer:
      "Wear what's comfortable!  Generally, atheletic wear is a good idea."
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I dance with only my partner?',
    answer:
      'You can dance with whoever you want!  Jst let the teachers know beforehand, since we rotate partners by default in our classes'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to become proficient?',
    answer:
      "This depends on what you mean by 'Proficient'.  If you just want to have fun and enjoy a night of dancing, that can take as little as 30 minutes.  It can take a few months for you to really feel comfortable.  That said, the best way to learn is to get out and dance!"

  {
    question: 'What is swing dancing?',
    answer:
      'Swing dance actually refers to many forms of dance, including lindy hop, Charleston, east coast, balboa, shag, and more! It includes solo jazz routines in addition to these partnered dances. Swing came about in Harlem in the 1920s and evolved with the music of that time. It gained popularity throughout the big band era and later saw a revival in the 90’s. Swing continues to grow and evolve all over the world today.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What does Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced level mean?',
    answer:
      'You are considered a Beginner when you have less than two months of experience. You are intermediate when you have between 2 and 6 months experience.  You are ready for advanced elective classes when you have over 6 months of experience.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of music are we dancing to?',
    answer:
      'Swing is generally danced to jazz music from the 1920s to the 1950s. There are many contemporary bands that are great for dancing as well, and even some local jazz bands here in St. Louis.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I swing dance to modern music?',
    answer:
      "You can dance to anything you want!  That said, the more you learn about the dance and the more adept you become, the more you will want to dance to jazz. Dances are created based on the music, not the other way around. Eventually, dancing Lindy Hop to anything other than Jazz just doesn't feel right."
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the age range of people who dance Lindy Hop?',
    answer:
      'Anyone can dance Lindy Hop!  While majority of people who take our classes are college students and young professionals between 21 and 35, one of the best dancers in STL is 65 years old.  '
  },
  {
    question: 'What do I wear to a dance?',
    answer:
      "This depends on whether the dance has live music or not.  For a random weekly dance, where what's comfortable.  This can be anything from jeans and a t-shirt to yoga pants and active-wear.  If there is live music, it's considered respectful to the band to dress up a bit(not to mention fun!).  Shoot for business casual."
  },

  {
    question: 'Where can I go to social dance?',
    answer:
      'Check Our Calendar!  We have listed the weekly social dances.  If you are wondering which dance to go to, We recommend the LHSL sponsored monthly dance at Mahler Ballroom.  Check to Calendar to see times, dates, and location.'
