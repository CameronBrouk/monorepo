      Swing Dancing is a way to meet new people, have fun, and get in shape.
      Just walk up to someone new, ask them to dance, and spend the next few
      minutes hopping and stomping your heart out to upbeat jazz music! Whether
      you want to have incredible experiences with people you just met, impress
      your friends at weddings, make art through movement, or compete against
      your peers, Swing Dancing will never let you down.
